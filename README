This is the README file for GtkEveMon. It covers:

* Building GtkEveMon
* Running GtkEveMon
* Installing GtkEveMon
* Uninstalling GtkEveMon


STEP 1: BUILDING
=====================================================================

GtkEveMon comes in form of source code. You can take a look at the
code, it's all located in the "src/" directory. In order to execute
it, it needs to be build.

Execute the following command:

$ make multicore

The "multicore" argument is for faster compilation on multicore
machines but it should also work if you don't have a multicore CPU.
If it does not work, simply call "make" without arguments.


STEP 2: RUNNING
=====================================================================

Note that you DO NOT NEED to install GtkEveMon in order to use it.
If you don't want to install GtkEveMon, issue the following commands,
relative to this README file:

$ cd src
$ ./gtkevemon

If you're going to install GtkEveMon (read below), just type
"gtkevemon" anywhere in your system or make a nice shortcut in
your window manager yourself.


OPTION: INSTALLING
=====================================================================

Make sure your current working directory is relative to this file.
To install GtkEveMon execute the following command (as super user):

# make install

The files will be installed to "/usr/local/bin". If you want to change
that, edit the Makefile.

A version of the "SkillTree.xml" file is build into the binary.
If you need to use a different version of the file, place it
into "~/.gtkevemon" and it will be used.
Ignore this if you don't know what I'm talking about.


OPTION: UNINSTALLING
=====================================================================

If you want to uninstall GtkEveMon, just type
following command (as super user):

# make uninstall

This will not remove your user data in your home directory.
